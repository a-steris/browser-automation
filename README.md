## Setup

1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Generate secure keys for encryption and session management:
   ```bash
   # Generate a secure encryption key
   python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
   
   # Generate a secure session key
   python -c "import os; print(os.urandom(24).hex())"
   ```

4. Configure your `.env` file with the generated keys:
   ```env
   # Required for encryption of sensitive data
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_generated_encryption_key
   
   # Required for secure session management
   SECRET_KEY=your_generated_session_key
   
   # Your API keys (these will be encrypted at rest)
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_key
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your_slack_webhook
   ```

3. Configure your environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your_slack_webhook_url  # Optional
   EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_email  # Optional
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password  # Optional
   ```

4. Access features:
   - View real-time balance
   - Monitor recent payments
   - Generate and export reports
   - Send reports to Slack or email (for slack you have to connect a slack bot)

## Development

2. Use Stripe test API keys for development, and AWS access key(s)
3. Test data can be generated from the dashboard
4. All API routes are protected with login_required

## Security Notes

1. Never commit your `.env` file to version control
2. Only use test mode API keys during development
